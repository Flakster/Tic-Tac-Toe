# Tic-Tac-Toe
  This is the development in Ruby language of the classical game (aka noughts and crosses) 
  in which two players take turns to place their marks ( 0 or X ) in the available positions 
  of a 3 x 3 board. The first player who achieves to place three of their marks in a horizontal,
  vertical, or diagonal line is the winner.

# Game Instructions

This is a two-player game in which every participant has a mark, either X or 0.
The final goal is to place three his/her marks on a 3 x 3 board in a vertical, 
horizontal, or diagonal line.

After typing the player's names, the first turn will be for the player with the X's 
and then, the game will prompt alternating between the two players asking for the 
position in the board in which the player wants to place his/her mark.

Each player can choose only one position on the board per movement, so he/she must 
pick the more convenient position in order to achieve the goal to position three of 
his/her marks in line. 

Sometimes, the player must use his/her turn for placing a mark that blocks the opponent's 
path to win. In such a case, the board is likely to be full without any of the participants
winning. If that situation arises, the game will end in a draw.
