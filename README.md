# Tic-Tac-Toe
  This is the development in Ruby language of the classical game (aka noughts and crosses) 
  in which two players take turns to place their marks ( 0 or X ) in the available positions 
  of a 3 x 3 board. The first player who achieves to place three of their marks in a horizontal,
  vertical, or diagonal line is the winner.
